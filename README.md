# CalculatorApp
My First Calculator App created in Visual Studios. 
The Calculator performs basic arithmetic functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The calculator displays "Lol. No." if you attempt to divide by zero. 
The calculator has functioning ON, OFF, and AC buttons.
The buttons WILL NOT resize to the form. I have not learned this yet.
